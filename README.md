# **My site**

## **Well, this is about me, my projects and my perspectives on the future.**

I also used it to have fun with some apis and show some things I know how to do. I did it with love, please visit [here](http://caiankeller.vercel.app).

## **I truly have more plans**
I'm still going to make this fully dynamic, using the node server that I quickly made, where I managed to expose all my apis tokens in a single file ðŸ˜… (it's why this backend'll still a secret for a time). I planned to make the backend open source, to help front-end developers who don't have some server knowledge, get information on their Github repositories or from other sites, like lichess, like I did. But I'm studying to find out if a centralized server is better than letting everyone implement their own server, even though that's much harder.

## **"No ReactRouter??"**
Eehh. When I started this project, things scaled very quickly, honestly I forgot about React Router, and it still seems like overkill for a project with 3 "pages". But after hearing some things about the importance of router for a site's seo, I'm a bit inclined to implement that, even that killing my beautiful animations ðŸ¥². 

## **I like this aesthetic**
Or I used to like it. Anyway, I tried to do a sophisticated design and this looks a bit old and a lo-fi site. So I'll update it when I have time.
